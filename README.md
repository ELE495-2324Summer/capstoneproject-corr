## Introduction
Currently, autonomous vehicle technologies are rapidly developing and finding applications in various fields. Autonomous parking systems are of great importance, especially for solving the problem of finding parking spaces in crowded cities. In this project, an autonomous vehicle parking system will be designed using Jetson Nano and JetBot. The goal is to design a parking system with a vehicle that can autonomously park in a designated parking area through a mobile application.

## Features
Key features and functionalities of the project.
### Hardware:
- JetBot               : A small, affordable AI robot built around the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano   : A small, powerful computer for AI development.
- CSI Camera Module    : Used for capturing video feed for digit recognition.
- TCS3200 Color Sensor : Used to detect the color red.
- Wi-Fi Module         : Provides wireless connectivity for remote control and communication.


### Operating System and packages
The project runs on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which uses the Ubuntu-based JetPack operating system. The key packages and libraries used include:
- JetPack SDK : Provides a full development environment for AI applications.
